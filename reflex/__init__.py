''' Events system for Python.
    Created by photofroggy.
    Released under GNU GPL v3.
    
    The idea of this was to keep things simple but still alow things to be
    quite powerful. Therefore I have introduced the idea of "event rules",
    where events can have a class assigned to them to handle bindings,
    unbindings, and triggers.
    
    Hopefully this will allow for a flexible and powerful module system.
