    This module provides interfaces for different parts of the event
    system. The one that will be most commonly used by other developers
    is the reactor class.

class Reactor(object):
    """ Reactor base class.
        
        Input parameters:
            
        * **manager** - This is a reference to an instance of a
          :ref:`reflex.control.EventManager <eventmanager>` object.
          This is used here to provide the base reactor class with the ``bind()``,
          ``unbind()``, ``handler()`` and ``trigger`` methods. For
          more information about these methods, see the
          documentation for the ``reflex.control.EventManager``
          class.
        * *args* and *kwargs* - Any additional parameters given here
          are passed to the ``init()`` method.
        
        In the reflex system, a *reactor* is an object containing several
        methods which react to *events*, based on certain parameters.
        The methods that react to events are usually referred to as
        *'event handlers'*.
        
        To define a method as an *event handler*, the method must be
        *bound* to an event using the ``bind()`` method. This creates an
        *event binding*. An *event binding* is an object (instance of
        ``reflex.data.Binding``) that holds information about the
        relationship between a method and an event.
        
        Developers adapting Reflex for their own applications are
        advised to use the ``reactor`` class as a base for any base
        classes they might want to create.
        
        To get an idea of how to properly create and use reactors, refer
        to the tutorials.
