''' Events system for Python.
    Created by photofroggy.
    Released under GNU GPL v3.
    
    The idea of this was to keep things simple but still alow things to be
    quite powerful. Therefore I have introduced the idea of "event rules",
    where events can have a class assigned to them to handle bindings,
    unbindings, and triggers.
    
    Hopefully this will allow for a flexible and powerful module system.

    """ The EventManager class provides a simple way to manage
        events and their bindings. This is one of the main things
        that application developers should be interested in using.
        
        Using the EventManager class is simple. All you have to do
        is make an instance of the class, then create event bindings
        using the ``bind()`` method. Once you have done that, you can trigger
        events using the ``trigger()`` method. A simple example is below::
        
            from reflex.data import Event
            from reflex.control import EventManager
            
            events = EventManager()

                print('Hello, world')
            
            events.bind('main app', example, 'test')
            
            events.trigger(Event('test'))
        
        The above example does not show the full power of the system. View
        the tutorials to get a better idea of how things can be used.
