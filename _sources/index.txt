Reflex - An Event System
==================================
**Reflex** is a Python package created by `photofroggy <http://photofroggy.deviantart.com>`_.

The package provides an event system to application developers, allowing developers to create applications where events can be handled by methods, based on certain parameters.

By extension, the package allows developers to create applications with event-based extension systems, allowing customisation of how the application works. The system provided is quite powerful, yet can be used for simple applications. It is generally recommended to use this when a complicated system may be required.
