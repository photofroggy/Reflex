Reflex Concepts
===============

Reflex provides a base for an event system usable by any applications, and can
also be used to create a more robust plugin system. The package provides an
interface which can be used on a very basic level to achieve a full system
easily, but more complicated systems can be created with a greater understanding
of the different concepts used in Reflex.

These pages aim to help with grasping the concepts of Reflex. Use these pages
along with the :doc:`package reference <../../reference/index>` and the
:doc:`tutorials <../tutorials/index>`.
